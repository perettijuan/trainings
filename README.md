# trainings

This repository contains excersices from several trainings that I've taken and some books that I've read. Most of them are  Java based, but the idea is to introduce and refresh base concepts of software development.

## CheeseFinder-starter
Base project [Ray Wenderlich RxAndroid tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/141980/rxandroid-tutorial?utm_source=Android+Weekly&utm_campaign=7128946b09-androidweekly-240&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4eb677ad19-7128946b09-337292713). It contains all the base examples from that tutorial.

## MoviesPreview
First Movies Preview app version. It contains some implementations that were usefull for a while:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - A very basic MVP approach, that was aborded when MVP was being introduced into the Android ecosystem.
    <br/>
    - Base event-bus implementation via EventController.
    <br/>
    - Clean architecture implementation via UseCase.
    <br/>
    <br/>
This code has evolved into the much more elaborated [MoviesPreview](https://github.com/perettijuan/moviespreview) application.

## cracking_the_code_interview
Training code that solves some problems from the Cracking The Code Interview - 150 Programing Questions and Solutions, Gayle Laakman.

## interviewcake
Some exersices from the [Interviewcake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) website.

## sorting_algorithms
Basic and advanced sorting algoritms implementations to be used as library.

## strings
Some very common interview programing questions using Strings.

## trees
Tree implementation used in some project (don't remember which one). It has a set of utils that allows traversal in different orders, insertions, deletions and more.

## ConstraintLayout examples
Examples of use of ConstraintLayout, based on this [post](http://www.uwanttolearn.com/android/constraint-layout-animations-dynamic-constraints-ui-java-hell/?utm_source=Android+Weekly&utm_campaign=6222cbbb6f-android-weekly-243&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4eb677ad19-6222cbbb6f-337292713)
